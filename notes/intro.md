# Intro 

MongoDB is a noSQL database, and it is non-relational. They scale more easily compared to relational databases, because the redundancy issues and architecture is handled by the system itself, not by the database maintainer. Types, fields, tables and so on is not dealt with. 

noSQL is usually the way to go unless the data is very interconnected and datasets are not that big. 

in MongoDB, a set of data is stored as a _Document_. Similar documents does not have to contain the same things, as rows in relational tables would.

In this analogy, the table is called a _Collection_ 

"A collection has documents" 

Documents automatically has an ID (Primary key) wich is called an _Object ID_.
